# Premier-League-Match-Predictor

This project demonstrates how to use a Random Forest classifier from scikit-learn to predict the outcomes of Premier League soccer matches. The data used for training and testing the model is sourced from a publicly available CSV file.

# Overview
The main goals of this project are:

* Data Preprocessing: Clean, organize, and transform the raw CSV data into a format suitable for machine learning.
* Feature Selection: Identify relevant features such as team statistics, recent performance, home/away advantage, etc.
* Model Building: Use a RandomForestClassifier to train and predict match outcomes.
* Evaluation: Assess prediction performance via metrics such as accuracy and precision.

# How It Works
* Data Loading: Reads match data from the CSV file.
* Model Training: Trains a RandomForestClassifier on the processed features.
* Prediction & Evaluation: Uses the trained model to predict the outcome of each match, then compares predictions to actual results.

# Next Steps
* Experiment with Different Models: Try algorithms such as XGBoost or LightGBM to see if performance improves.
* Add More Features: Incorporate additional data like player injuries, team lineups, or advanced statistics.
* Cross-Validate: Use cross-validation techniques to further validate the robustness of your model.
